## 🔍 Overview
Data Science is the field of study that uses **scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data**.  
This repository covers the **core building blocks** for anyone starting their journey:

- 🔧 **Python & Environment** → Setup, Jupyter Notebooks, package management  
- 📊 **Data Wrangling** → NumPy (arrays) and Pandas (tabular data)  
- 📈 **Visualization** → Matplotlib & Seaborn charts for insights  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** → Regression, Classification, Clustering with Scikit-Learn  
- 🧪 **Projects** → End-to-end workflows on real datasets

## 💡 Tips & Tricks  

✅ Practice on **real datasets** – theory alone won’t stick.  
✅ Join communities (GitHub, Kaggle, Reddit) to learn collaboratively.  
✅ Study in **small consistent sessions** (daily > binge learning).  
✅ Teach back concepts (notes, blogs) → best way to reinforce.  
✅ Stay updated – Data Science evolves fast! 🚀
